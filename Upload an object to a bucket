Use the gcloud alpha storage cp command:
gcloud alpha storage cp OBJECT_LOCATION gs://DESTINATION_BUCKET_NAME/
Where:

    OBJECT_LOCATION is the local path to your object. For example, Desktop/dog.png.

    DESTINATION_BUCKET_NAME is the name of the bucket to which you are uploading your object. For example, my-bucket.

If successful, the response looks like the following example:

Completed files 1/1 | 164.3kiB/164.3kiB

example:
gcloud alpha storage cp my-project-data-tutorial-12d27fc8fc45.json gs://tutorial_bucket_jana
Copying file://my-project-data-tutorial-12d27fc8fc45.json to gs://tutorial_bucket_jana/my-project-data-tutorial-12d27fc8fc45.json
  Completed files 1/1 | 2.3kiB/2.3kiB
